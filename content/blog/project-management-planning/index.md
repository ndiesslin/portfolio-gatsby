## intro:

Project management is tough, but it doesn't have to be. This is a compilation of thoughts and approaches around planning and executing successful project management.

### Problem:

There are a lot of different problems technical companies and groups face around project management, here are a list of some that come to mind

1. Lacking a project manager
2. Tools guiding the project management process
3. Misuse of project management tools
4. Lack of process to guide better project management
5. Lack of experience around project management

### Solutions:

Since it's much easier to point out problems rather than bring forth solutions, this list is much more important then the list of problems in project management.

1. Creating a process that everyone can adhere to and get on board with
2. Create your process without the project management tool in mind, you want to create a framework that could be used without certain technologies or tools in mind
3. Have shared responsibilities that don't 100% rely on one person
4. Have a person such as a project manager to help keep processes in order
5. When certain things aren't working take a step back and think through your process to bring forth solutions
6. Understand your tool that you ar using for project management and how you can use it to implement the process you created

## System concepts or principles

This is an example of how you could help define ideas for your project management systems.

### Creating tasks

I originally started understanding better tasks when working with team members who were remote, I understood after awhile that tasks need to be created in a way they can be worked on asynchronously by most anyone. When creating tasks this is a list of helpful ideas on some things one might think about:

1. Come up with a title naming convention
    1. You will want a format fitting to your projects and team size
    2. Examples may be PROJECT - Task, or CALL TO ACTION - Task
2. Always have a summary provided with what the tasks goal is, this may be in the form of a user story or it may just be a task simply outlines, it should provide the person working on the task with more information than the title
3. Provide needed information to accomplish the task such as specs or example logins
4. Provide needed assets for accomplishing the task
5. Label systems or categories may be helpful if you have the ability for it
6. Use checklists on your tasks if you have multiple steps to successfully complete the task, make sure this is used thoughtfully and you do now end up creating a task with a checklist of tasks
7. If you are able to, provide annotated screenshots, photographs, videos, or screen recordings to help provide any information that might not be clear
8. If there is a deadline for the task it's helpful to provide a deadline that matches your timeline
9. Sometimes it might be helpful to provide dialog in tasks to provide context, make sure this isn't what defines the task and this may only provide redundancy from the summary of the task
10. You may create a main task for a larger project and sub tasks that are required to complete the main task, but each task should be siloed to complete the main task

### Creating timelines

In my mind a good timeline can be completed in a realistic situation and if things go wrong. This means there might be buffer, but this is really to provide room for error and a better plan for success.

Here is a list of things that helps craft a better timeline:
1. Know the requirements, if you don't have all the requirements add more buffer and the note to stakeholders that information is missing so the timeline is slightly less reliable and because of this, more information should be gathered
2. Have most the tasks defined ahead of time, if you can also have level of efforts for each this will help define the timeline as well
3. Figure out the timing for most pieces and what parts will rely on each other
4. Start putting together a weekly schedule for the main tasks adding space for unknowns and potential tasks to be mixed in
5. Know that sometimes a realistic timeline might seem a little longer than what you'd expect, but this helps you either meet or exceed the deadline and that's ultimately the goal of a timeline
