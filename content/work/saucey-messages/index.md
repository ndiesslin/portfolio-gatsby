description: "<strong>Saucey Messages</strong> is a fun project I created that I thought of one day. It's a sauce packet message generator where you can create messages on a custom sauce packet and send to people. This project uses purely <strong>Vanilla JS</strong>, plain <strong>CSS</strong> and is hosted on Firebase."
