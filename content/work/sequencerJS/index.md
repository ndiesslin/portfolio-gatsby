title: Sequencer.JS
description: 'Sequencer.JS was created for a motion scripting class. It utilizes processing.js, lowLag.js, dat.gui.js and jquery. The ultimate idea of a sequencer is to sequence through each drum track to play music. This was relatively easy to accomplish by using loops in JavaScript. The buttons are built using proccesing.js and the playback is controlled using dat.gui. This project works best using Google Chrome.'
