title: My Mohawk Rewards
description: 'For <strong>My Mohawk Rewards</strong> I was tasked with creating a <strong>front-end framework</strong> for a backend team to integrate with three different site brands. To do this I used middleman to build different page components and different pages, I created a <strong>SCSS</strong> theme framework to easily create new brands. One highlight from this project was creating responsive tables with collapsible columns'
