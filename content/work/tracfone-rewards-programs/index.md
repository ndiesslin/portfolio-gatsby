title: Tracfone Rewards Programs
description: 'I was originally tasked with creating the front end for StraightTalk Rewards, then the client (Tracfone), tasked us with creating four different branded version for them (TotalWireless, Net10, SimpleMobile, and Tracfone Rewards). I used <strong>Gulp</strong> with <strong>SCSS</strong> to share styles for different brands and to theme each brand.'
