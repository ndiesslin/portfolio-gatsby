title: The For Project
description: "<strong>The For Project</strong> was a very neat project in which a user would link their card to their profile and when the user shopped at merchants in store they could pick a nonprofit in which portions of the merchant fee would be donated to the user's designated nonprofit. This was build with <strong>Ruby on Rails , VueJS, Bootstrap, and hosted with Heroku and RDS.</strong>"
